# Redeem
## General Info
Redeem is a software product that allows a company to register itself and its workers
in order to be able to assign to these certain amounts of money (which can be considered
incentives, bonuses, benefits or premiums) in order to allow them to redeem or exchange
the own products of the company. The process of redeeming the amount of money can be carried
out within the application in a section specially designed for it in which the list of
products or services of the company will be displayed with their respective data, simulating
something similar to a virtual store.
